        <h1>OMG CPTSD</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Trauma-Informed Yoga • 1:1 Support • Body-Based Healing</p>
    </div>

    <h2>That Moment When It All Makes Sense</h2>
    <p>You know that feeling—when you first learned about complex PTSD and suddenly your whole life clicked into place? The relief of finally having words for what you've been carrying?</p>
    
    <p>I offer individualized yoga sessions for those of us navigating this wonderfully messy thing called complex PTSD recovery. This work honors wherever you are in your process—the "OMG I'm having a moment" days, the breakthrough days, and all the beautifully imperfect days in between.</p>

    <div class="approach-section">
        <h2>How We Work Together</h2>
        <p>Our sessions create space for your nervous system to find its own rhythm. We work with breath, gentle movement, and grounding practices that help you reconnect with your body's innate capacity for healing.</p>
        
        <p>I get that trauma recovery is not linear. Some days you're feeling capable and grounded, other days you can barely get out of bed. Some sessions you might need to move and shake things off, others you need to curl up in child's pose. Sometimes your brain won't stop talking (hello, hypervigilance), and sometimes words tumble out that have been waiting to be heard.</p>
        
        <p>All of it is welcome here. Your protective mechanisms aren't problems to fix—they're parts of you that have been working overtime to keep you safe. The practice often helps quiet that internal chatter and guides us back into our bodies, but we follow whatever wants to unfold.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="important-note">
        <h3>About Scope and Boundaries</h3>
        <p>I'm not a licensed therapist, counselor, or mental health professional. What I offer is trauma-informed yoga support that works beautifully alongside—but doesn't replace—professional therapeutic care.</p>
        
        <p>I deeply respect the therapeutic process and know that healing often requires both body-based practices and professional mental health support. Think of this as one tool in your toolkit, not the whole toolkit.</p>
        
        <p>That said, I'm someone who can sit comfortably with whatever shows up—your freeze response, your internal critic, your need to talk through what you're feeling in your body. I've been in my own healing process long enough to know that sometimes we just need someone who gets it.</p>

    <h2>What to Expect</h2>
    <p>Sessions are tailored to your unique needs and wherever you're at that day. We might work with gentle movement, breathing practices, grounding techniques, or simply creating space for whatever your system needs.</p>
    
    <p>You're always in the driver's seat. We go at your pace, honor your boundaries, and trust your body's wisdom. No spiritual bypassing, no "just think positive" nonsense—just real, embodied support for real human experiences.</p>
